## About Me

Hey! I'm **Sanidhya Soni** — a security engineer and CTF developer who specializes in Red Teaming, CTF development, and exploring adversarial emulation.

## My Journey

My journey into cybersecurity started during college when I opened Wireshark for the first time — and instantly got hooked. Since then, I've been deep into red teaming, exploit development, and creating CTFs that (hopefully) confuse and challenge others the way I was when I started out.

## Professional Experience

I've worked with:
- **Military cyber units** - Designing red teaming frameworks for defense personnel
- **Red team projects** - Collaborating on penetration testing and adversary emulation
- **CTF development** - Built 50+ challenges for conferences and companies
- **Security assessments** - Conducted comprehensive testing across web, mobile, and network environments

## Certifications

- OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP) - 2023
- OffSec Wireless Professional (OWSP) - 2023
- Certified Network Security Practitioner (CNSP) - 2022
- Fortinet Network Security Expert Level 2 - 2022

## What I Do Now

Right now, I spend most of my time:
- Building security labs and infrastructure
- Testing systems and discovering vulnerabilities
- Creating CTF challenges
- Researching adversary techniques
- Sharing knowledge through writeups and this blog
